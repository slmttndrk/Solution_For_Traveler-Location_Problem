# Solution_For_Traveler-Location_Problem
  The aim of the project is to simulate the decision pattern for the travelers which are interested in going 
some locations according to their facilities using functional programming knowledge and Scheme language.

# Procedure

In the traveler_solution.rkt
  - There is a code to simulate the solution of traveler-location problem.

In the traveler_solution.bak
  - There is a code to simulate the solution of traveler-location problem and a given example traveler-location input for simulation.
  
# Execution

  You can run these codes on DrRacket.
